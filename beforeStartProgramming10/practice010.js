/**
 * The area A of a circle is given by the formula:
                                                A = π*r^2
Where:
A = Area of the circle
r = Radius of the circle (distance from the center to any point on the edge)
π (pi) ≈ 3.14 (a mathematical constant)

If a circle has a radius r = 7 units,
its area is:
            A = 3.14 * (7^2) square units
              = 153.86 square units
